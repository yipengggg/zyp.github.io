## About Me

MS in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics from the University of Pennsylvania, 2025.  
Exchange(Erasmus) in Mechanical Engineering from EPFL, 2023
BS in Mechanical Engineering from Sorbonne University, 2023.

A passionate researcher dedicated to designing innovative robotic systems inspired by natural mechanisms. Experienced in soft robot fabrication, flow dynamic analysis, and data-driven optimization. Skilled in applying machine learning techniques to optimize robotic control systems and streamline simulation development. Currently working on squid-inspired robotic propulsion and flow-field analysis at the GRASP Laboratory's Sung Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Research Interests

- **Soft Robotics:** bio-inspired design, material fabrication, actuation mechanisms, locomotion strategies
- **Flow Dynamics:** vortex analysis, flow visualization, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
- **Machine Learning:** Equivariant Neural Networks (E(3)NNs), Evidential Learning

## News
